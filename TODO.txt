xit-parse.js:// TODO - If this gets >=400 lines, might be best to pull constants out into own file
xit-parse.js:// TODO -> Is this a good solution? Or is there a way to modify the regex we have above?
xit-parse.js:    priorityLine: /^.*([!]|[.]*[!]){1,} .*/gm, // FIXME -> this currently accepts "!.!" forms as valid, which is not the case. I see this as a formatting thing for now, so low priority fix.
xit-parse.js:    // NOTE / TODO -> 'groups' as a value might be unnecessary in the long run. Values could just be the UUIDs, but we'll see how it works out on the UI
xit-parse.js:    // TODO -> Need some better "invalid" line handling. Right now I think we gracefully handle with a good-faith guess, but we should commit to either throwing an error or continuing with tbe best guess.
xit-parse.js:        // TODO -> content/rawContent newline type check could be cleaned up, fine as is.
xit-parse.js:        // TODO (?) -> Originally out of scope, but could be nice to refactor some of this and then provide a way to create a new xit object via an xit class...
xit-parse.js:    // TODO -> Need some better "invalid" group handling. Right now I think we gracefully handle with a good-faith guess, but we should commit to either throwing an error or continuing with tbe best guess.
