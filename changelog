1.2.1
-----

- Updated TODOs/FIXMEs to note possible future Xit POJO class - currently unsure if that is within scope of this project
- Updated README to contain properties added in 1.2.0

1.2.0
-----

- Updated `toString` to use the provided xit object's properties to build the string, instead of its rawContent, which may or may not match, depending on client usage/mutation. If this were more than a parser, I'd consider providing update methods for the xit object. For now, that's on the client IMO.
- Added `priorityLevel` and `priorityPadding` to the modifiers group in the object representation

1.1.0
-----

- Updated the `content` property of the Xit Object. It now returns the "human readable", sanitized content - content without modifiers, status delimiters, etc.
- Added the `rawContent` property to the Xit Object. This is what `content` used to be, the raw, unchanged content from a line of Xit.
- Added new constants (and some that were missing) to list that are exported along with xit-parse functions.

1.0.2
-----

- Added support for the new [?] item status
- Added a test script + test xit file for my own use, until I get around to writing proper tests
- Fixed the export in xit-parse, so it is easier to use (e.g. import * as xit... -> xit.toObject, instead of my silly xit.default.toObject)
- Updated documentation
- Included new version of xit spec

1.0.1
-----

- Fixed a bug with the parser, the groups were setup as an array instead of an object, causing JSON functions like stringify not to work. Groups are setup as an object as expected now.
- Updated documentation

1.0.0
-----

- Released a working version of the parser!
